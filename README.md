# congkit-typing-helper-app

A small desktop app which helps you learn congkit(also known as cangjie) typing method and speed up your typing.

Implemented with `React.js`, `Electron.js`

## Idea comes from:

You might find it much harder to type on computers when you are using congkit typing method, especially if you are a beginner. Chances are you have to frequently lower you head and look at your keyboard and search for the correct key and character you need. (Every beginner must paste some stickies on the keyboard, I believe...) It really slows down your typing.

But when it comes to mobile phone, you life is much easier because everything is on that screen. You don't have to look at somewhere else.

Inspired by that, I made this small app to "paste" the keyboard on the screen.

## What's include:

- Soft Keyboard with key mapping
- Typing hints
- Memo
- Search character from the dictionary
- Setting transparency

## Usage
